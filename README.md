# URL Shortener Microservice

This is my solution to the freeCodeCamp URL Shortener Microservice project challenge. More info can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice.

This microservice takes an URL and returns a json object with a shortened code for the URL. If a shortened code is inserted to the route /api/shorturl/, it will redirect to the original url 
(Example: (host)/api/shorturl/RHtW8Z9eU -> https://google.it)
